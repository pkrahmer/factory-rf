# Git and the hosting service

This file covers git and the hosting service; read the index, `README.md`, first.

## The hosting service

The factory reaches the hosting service (pull requests and their comments) only through the `HostingService` interface (an abstract base class) in `factory.application.hosting`. Nothing else may call it, and the application layer knows no concrete client. `PyGithubHostingService` (`factory.adapters.pygithub_hosting`) is the one client; `FakeHostingService` (`factory.adapters.fake_hosting`) is the one fake. Build comments from the service's data with `PullRequestComment.from_body`, so that `by_factory` and `key` always agree with the body.

The ten operations:

| Operation | Returns | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `create_pull_request(branch, title, body, *, draft)` | `PullRequestView` | open a pull request, as draft or ready |
| `find_open_pull_request(branch)` | `PullRequestView \| None` | the open pull request of a branch |
| `get_pull_request(number)` | `PullRequestView` | read state, draft flag and merge state |
| `list_comments(number)` | `list[PullRequestComment]` | comments with id and author |
| `post_comment(number, text, key)` | `PostOutcome` | post with the marker; `"already_posted"` if the key is already there |
| `close(number)`, `reopen(number)` | `None` | change the state |
| `set_draft(number, draft)` | `None` | mark draft or ready |
| `set_description(number, body)` | `None` | replace the description (the one projection of the work item) |
| `set_labels(number, labels)` | `None` | write the labels |

Labels are a projection of the stage: they are written and never read back, so no operation returns them and `PullRequestView` has no label field. `LABEL_PREFIX` (`"stage:"`) in `factory.domain.paths` is the prefix of those labels, and `MAIN_BRANCH` is `"main"`.

### The PyGithub client

`PyGithubHostingService(repository, kill_points=None)` implements the ten operations on a PyGithub `Repository`. It inherits `HostingService`, an abstract base class. The constructor reads nothing from the repository. `factory.entry.wiring` builds the `Repository` from the repository's `owner/name` and the token read from the token file.

- Every failing call raises `HostingServiceError(operation, detail)`: a `github.GithubException` or an `OSError` (a connection error is one) inside any of the ten operations is re-raised with the operation's name and `str(error)` as detail, chained to the original. Any other exception, and `InjectedKill`, passes through unchanged.
- `post_comment` lists the comments first and returns `"already_posted"` without posting when one has the same key; otherwise it posts `render_post(text, key)`, reaches `KillPoint.AFTER_POST` and returns `"posted"`.
- `find_open_pull_request` asks for open pull requests with head `<owner login>:<branch>`. A view's `state` is `merged` when PyGithub says merged, else `open` or `closed`; `merge_commit` is set only for a merged pull request, even though GitHub reports a test-merge commit for an open one.
- `list_comments` sorts by id, oldest first, and reads a naive `created_at` as UTC.
- `set_labels` keeps the labels that do not start with `LABEL_PREFIX` and adds the given ones; the names it read are never returned.
- `github` is imported by this module only. No module in `src/factory` imports another route to the hosting service (`requests`, `httpx`, `aiohttp`, `urllib3`, `urllib.request`, `http.client`, `socket`, `git`, `pygit2`, `dulwich`, `githubkit`) or contains the string `"gh"`; `tests/test_hosting_search.py` checks it.

Tests do not call PyGithub. `tests/adapters/test_pygithub_hosting.py` uses the recording stand-ins of PyGithub's objects in `tests/adapters/pygithub_stand_ins.py`, passed in with `typing.cast`. A real call is first seen by the baseline run. Use a low-entropy literal such as `"a" * 40` for a commit id in a test, so that `make secrets` stays green.

### The fake

Tests use `FakeHostingService(kill_points=None)` (`factory.adapters.fake_hosting`), through the `hosting` fixture in `tests/conftest.py` (built with the test's `kill_points`), and nothing else in place of the hosting service. It inherits `HostingService`, an abstract base class, so Python refuses a fake that leaves an operation out. `tests/test_hosting_fake_search.py` checks that only the fake and the PyGithub client define `post_comment`, and that no test class does.

It behaves as the PyGithub client does where a test can see it: a repeated post key returns `"already_posted"` and adds nothing, `merge_commit` is set only for a merged pull request, `set_labels` replaces only the labels that start with `LABEL_PREFIX` (others keep their order, the given ones come after), and every failing call raises `HostingServiceError`. `post_comment` reaches `KillPoint.AFTER_POST` after a `"posted"`, and not for `"already_posted"`.

Numbering is predictable: pull requests from 1, comment ids from 1 across all pull requests, the url of pull request `n` is `https://fake.invalid/pull/<n>`, and the `created_at` of comment `i` is 2026-10-12 UTC plus `i` seconds. A number that does not exist raises `HostingServiceError` from every operation that takes one.

The test operations act as the human or look at what the factory did:

| Operation | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `add_human_comment(number, body, *, author="human")` | add a comment as written; returns its id |
| `delete_comment(number, comment_id)` | remove a comment; an unknown id raises `HostingServiceError`; the id of a comment on another pull request counts as unknown, and that comment is left alone |
| `close_by_human(number)` | state `"closed"` |
| `merge_by_human(number, merge_commit)` | state `"merged"` with that `merge_commit` |
| `fail_next(operation, *, times=1)` | the next `times` calls of one of the ten operations raise `HostingServiceError(operation, "injected failure")` before any effect; an unknown name or `times` below 1 raises `ValueError` |
| `factory_posts(number)` | the comments with `by_factory` true, in order (how a test counts posts) |
| `labels(number)`, `description(number)` | what the factory wrote |
| `pull_requests()` | every pull request, whatever its state, by number |

```python
pull = hosting.create_pull_request("work-item/F0001-S0001", "title", "body", draft=True)
hosting.post_comment(pull.number, "Which option?", key)   # "posted"
hosting.add_human_comment(pull.number, "(a)")
assert len(hosting.factory_posts(pull.number)) == 1
```

### Data

The models in `factory.domain.hosting` are frozen, forbid unknown keys, and hold aware datetimes converted to UTC.

- `PullRequestView`: `number`, `branch`, `title`, `state` (`open`, `closed` or `merged`), `draft`, `merge_commit`, `url`. `merge_commit` is a 40-character lowercase hex commit id exactly when the state is `merged`, otherwise `None`.
- `PullRequestComment`: `id`, `author`, `body`, `created_at`, `by_factory`, `key`.

### The marker and the post key

Every post the factory makes ends with two lines: the marker `<!-- factory -->` and a key comment `<!-- factory key=<work item>:<kind>:<n> -->`, for example `<!-- factory key=F0001-S0001:question:7 -->`. `n` is lowercase hex and not empty; the key is made from the recorded journal entry's number, so a repeat or a restart posts nothing (see "Asking the human"); `kind` is one of `question`, `attempts_cap`, `round_cap`, `crash_cap`, `send_back`, `stall`, `expiry`, `correction`, `error`, `cost_table`.

- `render_post(text, key)` gives `text` without trailing whitespace, a blank line, the marker, and the key comment. Nothing follows.
- `parse_post_key(body)` reads only the last non-blank line, which must be exactly a valid key comment (trailing whitespace and `\r` are ignored). Anything else gives `None`.
- `PullRequestComment.from_body` sets `by_factory` when the body contains the marker, whoever the author is, and `key` to the parsed key when it is by the factory.

Why: see `docs/decisions.md`.

## The git wrapper

Git is reached only through the `Git` interface (`factory.application.git`, an abstract base class) and its one implementation `GitCli` (`factory.adapters.git_cli`), which inherits it. Every command goes through `run_process`; no other module starts git. It reads, and it writes the first things: clone, checkout, commit and push. It deletes branches and merges, and it restores the checkout: reset, revert and move (all below).

`GitCli(directory, options=None)` works in `directory`. `options` is a `GitOptions` (`factory.domain.git`; frozen, unknown keys forbidden), and `None` means `GitOptions()`:

| Field | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `identity` | `GitIdentity(name="factory", email="factory@noreply.invalid")` | author and committer of the factory's commits; non-empty name and email. The default is `DEFAULT_GIT_IDENTITY` (`factory.domain.git`), the one place that spells it; `factory.domain.settings` re-exports the same object, and an unset instance setting falls back to it |
| `environment` | `{}` | extra environment for git; each `GitOptions` has its own dict; `GitCli` adds `GIT_CEILING_DIRECTORIES` = the working copy's parent and `GIT_CONFIG_NOSYSTEM` after it, which no `environment` can lift, so git never looks for a repository above the working copy |
| `kill_points` | `None` | reached by `push` (see below) |
| `executable` | `"git"` | the program to run (tests give a stand-in) |
| `time_limit` | `GIT_TIME_LIMIT` (5 minutes) | per command |

`factory.entry.wiring` fills `identity` from the instance settings `GIT_USER_NAME` and `GIT_USER_EMAIL`, and `environment` with the credential helper for the factory's own pushes (the helper reads the token file; the token itself is never in the environment), so that the agent run never receives it.

The twenty-five operations of the `Git` interface (`tests/application/test_git_interface.py` checks that the interface has exactly these and that `GitCli` has each):

| Operation | Returns |
|---|---|
| `fetch()` | `None`; runs `git fetch --prune origin`, so branches the remote deleted disappear; any failure is `FetchFailed` |
| `remote_branches()` | `list[RemoteBranch(name, commit)]` from `refs/remotes/origin/`, name without `origin/`, sorted by name, without `HEAD`; local branches are never listed |
| `resolve(ref)` | the 40-character commit id, or `None` when there is no such ref (also `HEAD` without commits) |
| `show_file(ref, path)` | the text exactly as committed, or `None` when `path` is absent or a directory; an unknown `ref` is a `GitError` |
| `list_files(ref, directory)` | full paths of all files under `directory` (no trailing slash), recursive, in string order; `[]` when the directory is absent; an unknown `ref` is a `GitError` |
| `is_ancestor(ancestor, descendant)` | whether `ancestor` is reachable from `descendant` (a commit is its own ancestor); an unknown ref is a `GitError` |
| `clone(url)` | `None`; runs `git clone <url> <directory>` from the parent of the bound directory and creates missing parents. The directory must be missing or empty, otherwise `GitError`. Afterwards the checkout is on the remote's default branch with `origin` set |
| `checkout(branch, *, start_point=None)` | `None`; switches to the local branch, or creates it at `origin/<branch>` when only the remote has it. With `start_point` it creates the branch there or resets an existing one to it (`git switch --force-create`, the same as `checkout -B`). An unknown branch or start point, or changes that stand in the way, is a `GitError` and leaves the branch and the changes as they were |
| `commit(message)` | the new commit id; stages every change (`add --all`, ignored paths stay out) and commits `message` verbatim, unsigned. Nothing staged raises `NothingToCommit` (a `GitError`) and commits nothing |
| `push(branch)` | `PushOutcome`: `"pushed"`, `"rejected"` or `"unreachable"` (below) |
| `delete_remote_branch(branch)` | `PushOutcome`; runs `git push --porcelain origin --delete refs/heads/<branch>` (below) |
| `delete_branch(branch)` | `None`; deletes the local branch even when it is not merged. The checked-out branch is a `GitError` and stays; a branch that does not exist is no error and changes nothing |
| `merge(ref, *, fast_forward_only=False)` | `MergeOutcome` (below) |
| `reset_to(ref)` | `None`; `git reset --hard` then `git clean -fd` (below) |
| `remove_ignored()` | `None`; `git clean --quiet --force --force -d -X` removes every untracked path the ignore rules match (below) |
| `revert_paths(commit, paths)` | `None`; each path back to its content at `commit`, or deleted when it was not there (below) |
| `move(source, destination)` | `None`; `git mv` that creates the destination's folders (below) |
| `log(ref, *, since=None, path=None)` | `list[CommitInfo(commit, parents, subject, author, committed_at)]`: the commits reachable from `ref`, newest first, a commit always before its parents (a merge commit has two). `commit` and `parents` are full ids, `subject` is the first line of the message, `author` the author's name, `committed_at` the committer date in UTC. With `since`, only commits not reachable from it (`since == ref` gives `[]`); with `path`, only commits that changed that file or anything under that directory. An unknown `ref` or `since` is a `GitError` |
| `changed_paths(since)` | `list[ChangedPath(path, change)]`: the net difference between the commit `since` and the work tree, whether committed, staged, unstaged or untracked. Untracked files that are not ignored count, as `"added"`; ignored paths do not. A path added and deleted again, or changed and restored, is not listed. Sorted by path in plain string order. An unknown `since` is a `GitError` |
| `seal()` | `None`; takes the group's and others' write permission from `<directory>/.git` and from every entry in it (no git process; `os.walk` without following links, a symbolic link inside is left alone). It keeps the setgid, read and execute bits. Raises `RepositoryUnsealed` when the folder is missing, a symbolic link, not a directory, has no regular `HEAD`, belongs to another user than the effective one (checked before anything changes), or an entry cannot be read or changed |
| `check_seal()` | `None`; changes nothing and starts no git process. Raises `RepositoryUnsealed` unless `.git` is a directory (not a link) of the effective user, neither its group nor others may write, and it holds a regular `HEAD`. The `HEAD` check matters: a folder of the factory's that the group cannot write, renamed to `.git`, would pass the other checks |
| `remove_nested_repositories()` | `list[str]`; removes every entry named `.git` below the working copy other than the root's own (a folder, a file or a symbolic link, dangling or not) and returns their paths relative to the working copy, `/`-separated and sorted; `[]` when there is none. No git process: `os.walk` without following links, top-down, never entering a `.git`; every other folder, `.venv` included, is entered, and a folder the walk cannot list is skipped. A folder that is not a link goes by `shutil.rmtree`, anything else by `os.unlink`; the parent and its other files stay. An `OSError` raises `RepositoryUnsealed("<absolute path>: <error>")` |
| `work_tree_id(left_out=())` | `TreeId` (`factory.domain.git`, 40 lower-case hex characters, the pattern of `CommitId`): the id of the tree a commit of the work tree would record now, less the paths that match `left_out` (`matches_any`, as for write paths: case-sensitive, `*` also crosses `/`). Tracked files count with their content in the work tree, untracked files that are not ignored count, deleted and ignored files do not; a tracked file that `.gitignore` matches still counts, as in a commit. The tree is built in a temporary index, a copy of the checkout's own, set through `GIT_INDEX_FILE` and removed afterwards: `add --all`, then `update-index --force-remove --` for the left-out paths (literal paths, never pathspecs), then `write-tree`. The checkout's index, `HEAD`, refs and work tree stay as they are; the tree object itself is written to the object store. Any git failure is a `GitError` |
| `discard()` | `None`; `shutil.rmtree` of the working copy. A missing one is no error; any other failure is a `GitError` |
| `status()` | `WorkTreeStatus(branch, head, changes)`: `branch` is `None` when HEAD is detached, `head` is `None` in a repository without commits (`branch` then names the unborn branch). `changes` has one `ChangedPath` per path that differs from HEAD, staged, unstaged or untracked, listed once and sorted by path. A deleted path is `"deleted"`, a path HEAD lacks (untracked or newly staged, even if edited again) is `"added"`, anything else `"modified"`. Ignored paths are never listed |

`ChangedPath.change` is `"added"`, `"modified"` or `"deleted"` (`ChangeKind`); there is no `"renamed"`. Rename detection is off everywhere, so a rename is a deletion of the old path plus an addition of the new one. The four result models (`ChangedPath`, `CommitInfo`, `WorkTreeStatus`, `RemoteBranch`, in `factory.domain.git`) are frozen and forbid unknown keys; `committed_at` must be timezone-aware, and commit ids are 40 lowercase hexadecimal characters.

These three describe what the checkout holds; nothing is decided from them without the remote. Later features read recovery state from them: the undo compares the work tree with the stage-start commit (`changed_paths`), and the tick looks at `status()` before it restores the checkout.

Two edge cases are not exact: a path removed from the index with `git rm --cached` but still on disk shows as `"modified"` in `changed_paths` even when its content is unchanged, and unmerged paths in `status()` are `"modified"`.

Any other failure of a command (non-zero exit, cannot be started, `time_limit` reached) is a `GitError`. A missing ref or path is told apart from a failure by exit status and by `ls-tree -z` listings, never by git's wording.

Push never forces: it runs `git push --porcelain --set-upstream origin refs/heads/<branch>`. The outcome is a value, because the caller decides what a refusal means:

- `"pushed"`: git exited 0; afterwards `origin/<branch>` in the checkout is the pushed commit.
- `"rejected"`: the remote refused the update, a non-fast-forward or a remote hook that declined it (git marks the ref with `!`).
- `"unreachable"`: exit 128 with `Could not read from remote repository`, `does not appear to be a git repository`, `unable to access` or `Could not resolve host` in the output.
- Any other failure, such as an unknown local branch, is a `GitError`. A tag of the branch's name does not count as that branch: `push("v1")` with a local tag `v1` and no local branch `v1` is a `GitError` and pushes nothing.

The push kill points: `KillPoint.BEFORE_PUSH` is reached once per call, before git runs (between a commit and its push, so nothing reaches the remote); `KillPoint.AFTER_PUSH` is reached only after a push that returned `"pushed"`. A rejected or unreachable push reaches only the first. A `GitCli` without kill points pushes normally.

### Deleting and merging branches

`delete_remote_branch` returns the push outcomes with these meanings: `"pushed"` when the branch is gone from the remote afterwards, also when it was already gone (git exits 0 for a qualified name, so that is a plain success; the remote only warns). A tag of the same name on the remote is left alone; `"rejected"` when the remote refuses the deletion, for example a hook; `"unreachable"` under the same conditions as `push`. A name git would refuse, such as `a..b`, is a `ValueError` before git runs (see the branch rule below). Any other failure is a `GitError`. After `"pushed"` the remote-tracking ref `origin/<branch>` is gone from the checkout too, even when the remote branch was already gone and the checkout held a stale `origin/<branch>`. It reaches no kill point.

`merge` merges `ref` into the checked-out branch and returns a `MergeOutcome` (`factory.domain.git`), decided from the ancestry of the two commits, not from git's messages:

- `"up_to_date"`: `ref` is already contained in `HEAD`; nothing changes (also with `fast_forward_only`).
- `"fast_forwarded"`: `HEAD` is contained in `ref`; the branch moves to `ref` without a merge commit (also with `fast_forward_only`).
- `"not_fast_forward"`: the two have diverged and `fast_forward_only` is true; nothing changes.
- `"merged"`: diverged without conflict; a merge commit with git's default message (no editor, unsigned), `HEAD` and `ref` as parents, and the identity of the options as author and committer.
- `"conflict"`: the merge conflicts. It is aborted before the call returns, so `HEAD`, the index and the work tree are as they were and no merge is in progress. A conflict never leaves a merge half done.

An unknown `ref`, and any other refusal that leaves no merge in progress (for example local changes the merge would overwrite), is a `GitError` and changes nothing.

Who uses them: preparing a stage merges the main branch into a work item's branch (F0005); a merge or a discard deletes branches, remote and local (F0007).

### Restoring the checkout

These four make the checkout disposable: whatever a stage or a crash left behind can be put back.

- `reset_to(ref)` resolves `ref` to a commit, runs `git reset --hard` on it, then `git clean --force -d`. Tracked files, staged or not, go back to `ref` and the current branch points at it. Untracked files and directories are removed; ignored paths (a file named in `.gitignore`) stay: `remove_ignored()` takes them. An unknown `ref` is a `GitError` and nothing changes. The ref is resolved first, so git only ever sees a commit id (`reset` takes no `--end-of-options`); an option-like `ref` is refused earlier by the argument rule below.
- `remove_ignored()` runs `git clean --quiet --force --force -d -X` and removes every untracked path the ignore rules match, a folder with all it holds (`.venv`, `__pycache__`, the tool caches, `mutants/`, `.reports/`). The rules are those git reads: every `.gitignore` in the work tree, nested ones included, and `.git/info/exclude`. The second `--force` also removes an ignored folder that holds a repository. A symbolic link is removed as a link and its target is untouched; a link that no rule matches (a link named `.mypy_cache` against the folder rule `.mypy_cache/`) stays. Tracked files, untracked files that no rule matches (the agent's new files in its write paths) and the repository stay, and `status()` and `HEAD` are the same before and after. A path that cannot be removed (an ignored folder of mode `0o555` that holds a file) is a `GitError` whose command is `git clean --quiet --force --force -d -X`; no ignored path is no error. `reset_to`, the undo and the result commit do not change.
- `revert_paths(commit, paths)` brings each path to its content at `commit`, in the work tree and in the index. A path that does not exist at `commit` (added later, only staged, or untracked) is deleted from both. A path that exists nowhere is skipped without an error. Paths that were not given are not touched. An unknown `commit` is a `GitError`. A path that is a directory is not supported: the rules speak of files, and git then fails with a `GitError`.
- `move(source, destination)` creates the destination's parent folders and runs `git mv`; the move is staged as a rename (`status()` and `changed_paths()` still show it as a deletion plus an addition, see above). A `source` that is not tracked, or a `destination` that exists, is a `GitError`.

The path rule, for `revert_paths` (every path) and `move` (both arguments): a path is relative to the repository, with forward slashes. `factory.domain.git.check_repository_path` raises `ValueError` for an empty path, an absolute path or one with a `..` segment, and it runs before anything is changed or created. So `revert_paths` changes no path of a call that holds one bad path, and `move` creates no folder outside the checkout. `docs/a.txt` is fine, `../x` and `a/../../x` are not.

The argument rule, for every ref, branch, start point, commit and url: `factory.domain.git.check_git_argument` raises `ValueError` for an empty value and for one that starts with `-`, because git would read it as an option (`push("--force")` would force-push). No git ref, branch name or remote url starts with a dash, so nothing valid is lost; a hyphen inside a name (`work-item/F0001-S0001`) is fine. `GitCli` checks before it starts git and before any kill point, so a refused call starts no process, changes nothing and does not reach `BEFORE_PUSH`. The operations and arguments: `resolve(ref)`, `show_file(ref, …)`, `list_files(ref, …)`, `is_ancestor` (both), `log` (`ref`, and `since` when given), `changed_paths(since)`, `clone(url)`, `checkout` (`branch`, and `start_point` when given), `push`, `delete_remote_branch`, `delete_branch`, `merge(ref)`, `reset_to(ref)` and `revert_paths(commit, …)`. Why not `--end-of-options`: see `docs/decisions.md`. Inside an operation, git is read through the private `_resolve_unchecked`, `_is_ancestor_unchecked` and `_blob`, never through another public operation, so each argument is checked once.

The branch rule for pushing: `push` and `delete_remote_branch` call `factory.domain.git.check_branch_name` instead, because `git push` reads its branch as a refspec. It refuses everything `check_git_argument` refuses, and also a value that starts with `+` (it forces: `push("+main")` overwrites a diverged `main`), one that contains `:` (it names another ref or deletes one: `push(":keep")` deletes `keep`, `push("HEAD:refs/heads/other")` creates `other`) and one that contains `*` (a pattern that pushes every matching branch, or none). It also refuses the whole values `HEAD` and `@` (git pushes the checked-out branch under its own name) and anything `git check-ref-format --branch` would refuse, applied in the domain without calling git: `^`, `~`, `?`, `[`, `\`, space and control characters, `..`, `@{`, a leading, trailing or doubled `/`, a trailing `.`, and a component that starts with `.` or ends with `.lock`. `push("^main")` is a negative refspec that pushes nothing yet exits 0. A plus or an `@` inside a name (`a+b`, `a@b`) and `feature/HEAD` are fine. The refusal is a `ValueError` before git and before `BEFORE_PUSH`, and the remote is untouched. It refuses a name git itself allows (`+main`); the factory's names (`main`, `work-item/<id>`) never take that form.

The branch is also named `refs/heads/<branch>` on git's command line, as the source only, with no `:<dst>`. Without it git matches any ref of that name, so `delete_remote_branch("v1")` would delete a tag `v1` and `push("v1")` would push a local tag; with it a tag is never pushed or deleted as a branch. The local operations (`checkout`, `delete_branch`, `merge`, …) keep `check_git_argument`, because git reads no refspec there. Why not an explicit `refs/heads/<b>:refs/heads/<b>` refspec: see `docs/decisions.md`.

Who uses them: a stall or a crash reverts or resets (F0004, F0005, F0008); the tick resets the checkout to the remote (F0006); the undo's revert is this wrapper's, the rules for what to revert are F0004's; a merge or a discard moves the story file (F0007).

### Which feature uses which operation

| Operation | Used by |
|---|---|
| `changed_paths`, `revert_paths` | F0004: the undo compares the work tree with the stage-start commit and reverts chosen paths |
| `merge` | F0005: preparing a stage merges the main branch into the work item's branch |
| `remove_ignored` | F0027: after every agent run (`run_sealed`) and at the restore (the tick) |
| `status`, `reset_to` | F0006: the tick looks at the checkout and resets it to the remote |
| `reset_to` | also F0004, F0005 and F0008: a stall or a crash |
| `delete_remote_branch`, `delete_branch`, `move` | F0007: a merge or a discard |
| `work_tree_id` | F0023: the key of a known project-command result (S0002) is the tree the command would read |
| `fetch`, `remote_branches`, `resolve`, `show_file`, `list_files`, `is_ancestor`, `log`, `clone`, `checkout`, `commit`, `push` | the pipeline's reads and writes, used by the tick, the stages and the claim, and `clone` by the checkout preparer |

Identity: every call also sets `GIT_AUTHOR_NAME`, `GIT_COMMITTER_NAME`, `GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL` and `GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL` from `options.identity`, over the process environment and `options.environment`. No user or system configuration can change it, and `commit.gpgsign` is ignored. The wiring fills `identity` from `GIT_USER_NAME` and `GIT_USER_EMAIL`; a `GitCli` built without options commits as `factory <factory@noreply.invalid>`.

Configuration is isolated: each call runs with the process environment, then `options.environment`, then the identity, then `GIT_CONFIG_NOSYSTEM=1`, `GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL` set to the null device, and `LC_ALL=C`. The isolation, the identity and the locale come last, so `options.environment` cannot lift them. `LC_ALL=C` keeps git's messages English: the push outcomes `"unreachable"` and an already-deleted remote branch are recognised by them, and an operator's locale must not turn them into a `GitError`. It does not change how paths are read: the `-z` listings are the paths' bytes and `run_process` decodes them as UTF-8. Credentials therefore reach git only through the environment (for example `GIT_ASKPASS`, or `GIT_CONFIG_COUNT`, `GIT_CONFIG_KEY_<n>`, `GIT_CONFIG_VALUE_<n>`), never through global or system configuration, and never inside a URL, because git may print a URL. Why: see `docs/decisions.md`.

Tests use real git. The `remote` fixture is a bare repository in `tmp_path` with the pipeline definition, the story form and one feature with one story on `main`. `make_remote` builds it once per session (once per pytest-xdist worker, as the `remote_template` fixture), and each test gets a copy of the whole folder, seed and bare repository, made by `copy_remote(template, root)` without a git process, so what a test pushes stays its own; a test that needs a remote of its own layout builds it with `make_remote`. `checkout` is a `GitCli` on a clone of it (identity `TEST_IDENTITY`). `tests/git_support.py` has the helpers: `run_git` (through `run_process`, same isolation, author `Test Author`) and `write_executable` for a stand-in `executable`, and `remote_commit(remote, branch)`, which reads a branch of the bare remote with plain git and gives `None` when it is absent. Git is not faked. Tests check results with plain git through `run_git`, not through other `GitCli` methods.

The autouse fixture `reopened_tmp_path` in `tests/conftest.py` calls `reopen(tmp_path)` (`tests/tmp_path_support.py`) after every test that uses `tmp_path`, after the test's own teardowns. It gives the owner read, write and search permission on every folder and read and write on every other entry, links not followed. So a test that closes a folder, or a mutant of the seal that closes `.git`, leaves nothing pytest cannot remove, and a test need not open what it closed for that reason.

The `human` fixture (`HumanClone` in `tests/human_clone.py`) is a second clone of `remote`, the writer a push test needs besides `checkout`; it is built with `TEST_IDENTITY` and drives `GitCli`. `start(path)` moves a story file from `backlog/` to `in-progress/` on `main`, commits and pushes. `push_file(branch, path, text)` writes the file on that branch (created from `origin/main` if the remote has none), commits and pushes. `merge(branch, method)` brings `origin/<branch>` into `main` and pushes it: `"merge"` as a merge commit, `"squash"` as one ordinary commit that leaves the branch tip outside the history of `main`, `"rebase"` as the branch's commits replayed with no merge commit. Every push it makes must return `"pushed"`.
