# Project guide

The guide for agents working on `factory-rf`: how the code is laid out, where a change belongs, which conventions the checks do not catch, and what to read first. Nothing is built yet, so there is nothing to say yet. The documenter stage fills this in from the stories' docs criteria; until then `CLAUDE.md` holds the rules.

## Errors

`factory.domain.errors.FactoryError` is the root of every error the factory raises on purpose. Later stories add their error types under it. `InjectedKill` (below) is deliberately not one.

## Kill points: testing a crash

A test that must show the factory survives its own death arms a kill point. The seam is `factory.domain.kill_points`; the tests that use it to prove recovery come with the recovery features (F0008, F0011).

There are four points, the members of `KillPoint`:

| Point | Value | Reached by |
|---|---|---|
| `AGENT_RUN` | `agent-run` | the two agent runtimes, while an agent runs |
| `BEFORE_PUSH` | `before-push` | the git wrapper, before a push |
| `AFTER_PUSH` | `after-push` | the git wrapper, after a push |
| `AFTER_POST` | `after-post` | the fake hosting service and the PyGithub client, after posting |

This story built only the seam. A wrapper calls `kill_points.reach(point)` at its point in its own story; until then nothing reaches a point.

A new `KillPoints` is inert. In a test, use the `kill_points` fixture from `tests/conftest.py`, which returns a new `KillPoints()` for each test, and hand it to the wrapper under test:

```python
def test_push_dies_after_the_second_try(kill_points: KillPoints) -> None:
    kill_points.arm(KillPoint.BEFORE_PUSH, after=1)
    with pytest.raises(InjectedKill):
        ...  # code that reaches BEFORE_PUSH twice
    assert kill_points.reached(KillPoint.BEFORE_PUSH) == 2
```

- `arm(point)` makes the next `reach(point)` raise `InjectedKill`. `arm(point, after=n)` lets `n` reaches pass first and raises on the next; `after` counts from the arming. A negative `after` raises `ValueError` and changes nothing.
- A point fires once and is then inert again. Arming an armed point replaces the earlier arming. Arming one point never changes another, armed or not.
- `reached(point)` counts every reach, the one that raises included, armed or not.
- Each `KillPoints` instance has its own state.
- `str(InjectedKill(point))` is `injected kill at <point value>`, and `.point` is the point that fired.

`InjectedKill` is a `BaseException`; see `docs/decisions.md`.
