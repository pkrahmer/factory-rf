# Project guide

The guide for agents working on `factory-rf`: how the code is laid out, where a change belongs, which conventions the checks do not catch, and what to read first. It is filled in story by story. The documenter stage fills this in from the stories' docs criteria; until then `CLAUDE.md` holds the rules.

## Errors

`factory.domain.errors.FactoryError` is the root of every error the factory raises on purpose. Later stories add their error types under it. `InjectedKill` (below) is deliberately not one.

`BoundaryError` (a `FactoryError`) is the root of the errors for an outside party that failed. `HostingServiceError(operation, detail)` is its first subtype: every implementation of the hosting-service interface raises it for every failing call, and its message is `hosting service <operation> failed: <detail>`. `operation` and `detail` are attributes.

## The hosting service

The factory reaches the hosting service (pull requests and their comments) only through the `HostingService` protocol in `factory.application.hosting`. Nothing else may call it, and the application layer knows no concrete client. `PyGithubHostingService` (`factory.adapters.pygithub_hosting`) is the one client; the one fake follows in a later story. Build comments from the service's data with `PullRequestComment.from_body`, so that `by_factory` and `key` always agree with the body.

The ten operations:

| Operation | Returns | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `create_pull_request(branch, title, body, *, draft)` | `PullRequestView` | open a pull request, as draft or ready |
| `find_open_pull_request(branch)` | `PullRequestView \| None` | the open pull request of a branch |
| `get_pull_request(number)` | `PullRequestView` | read state, draft flag and merge state |
| `list_comments(number)` | `list[PullRequestComment]` | comments with id and author |
| `post_comment(number, text, key)` | `PostOutcome` | post with the marker; `"already_posted"` if the key is already there |
| `close(number)`, `reopen(number)` | `None` | change the state |
| `set_draft(number, draft)` | `None` | mark draft or ready |
| `set_description(number, body)` | `None` | replace the description (the one projection of the work item) |
| `set_labels(number, labels)` | `None` | write the labels |

Labels are a projection of the stage: they are written and never read back, so no operation returns them and `PullRequestView` has no label field. `LABEL_PREFIX` (`"stage:"`) in `factory.domain.paths` is the prefix of those labels, and `MAIN_BRANCH` is `"main"`.

### The PyGithub client

`PyGithubHostingService(repository, kill_points=None)` implements the ten operations on a PyGithub `Repository`. It satisfies `HostingService` structurally and does not inherit it. The constructor reads nothing from the repository. Wiring that builds the `Repository` from the token comes with `factory.entry.wiring` (F0002 onward, token in F0010).

- Every failing call raises `HostingServiceError(operation, detail)`: a `github.GithubException` or an `OSError` (a connection error is one) inside any of the ten operations is re-raised with the operation's name and `str(error)` as detail, chained to the original. Any other exception, and `InjectedKill`, passes through unchanged.
- `post_comment` lists the comments first and returns `"already_posted"` without posting when one has the same key; otherwise it posts `render_post(text, key)`, reaches `KillPoint.AFTER_POST` and returns `"posted"`.
- `find_open_pull_request` asks for open pull requests with head `<owner login>:<branch>`. A view's `state` is `merged` when PyGithub says merged, else `open` or `closed`; `merge_commit` is set only for a merged pull request, even though GitHub reports a test-merge commit for an open one.
- `list_comments` sorts by id, oldest first, and reads a naive `created_at` as UTC.
- `set_labels` keeps the labels that do not start with `LABEL_PREFIX` and adds the given ones; the names it read are never returned.
- `github` is imported by this module only. No module in `src/factory` imports another route to the hosting service (`requests`, `httpx`, `aiohttp`, `urllib3`, `urllib.request`, `http.client`, `socket`, `git`, `pygit2`, `dulwich`, `githubkit`) or contains the string `"gh"`; `tests/test_hosting_search.py` checks it.

Tests do not call PyGithub. `tests/adapters/test_pygithub_hosting.py` uses the recording stand-ins of PyGithub's objects in `tests/adapters/pygithub_stand_ins.py`, passed in with `typing.cast`; the fake hosting service follows in a later story. A real call is first seen by the baseline run. Use a low-entropy literal such as `"a" * 40` for a commit id in a test, so that `make secrets` stays green.

### Data

The models in `factory.domain.hosting` are frozen, forbid unknown keys, and hold aware datetimes converted to UTC.

- `PullRequestView`: `number`, `branch`, `title`, `state` (`open`, `closed` or `merged`), `draft`, `merge_commit`, `url`. `merge_commit` is a 40-character lowercase hex commit id exactly when the state is `merged`, otherwise `None`.
- `PullRequestComment`: `id`, `author`, `body`, `created_at`, `by_factory`, `key`.

### The marker and the post key

Every post the factory makes ends with two lines: the marker `<!-- factory -->` and a key comment `<!-- factory key=<work item>:<kind>:<n> -->`, for example `<!-- factory key=F0001-S0001:question:7 -->`. `n` is lowercase hex and not empty; `kind` is one of `question`, `attempts_cap`, `round_cap`, `crash_cap`, `send_back`, `stall`, `expiry`, `correction`, `error`, `cost_table`.

- `render_post(text, key)` gives `text` without trailing whitespace, a blank line, the marker, and the key comment. Nothing follows.
- `parse_post_key(body)` reads only the last non-blank line, which must be exactly a valid key comment (trailing whitespace and `\r` are ignored). Anything else gives `None`.
- `PullRequestComment.from_body` sets `by_factory` when the body contains the marker, whoever the author is, and `key` to the parsed key when it is by the factory.

Why: see `docs/decisions.md`.

## Starting a process

`subprocess` is imported, and a process started, in `factory.adapters.process` only (R5). The git wrapper, the make class and the `claude -p` runtime each reach their tool through `run_process(request) -> ProcessResult`; no other module calls a command-line tool.

`ProcessRequest` (frozen, unknown keys forbidden) holds:

- `argv`: the program and its arguments, at least one element, passed as given. There is never a shell, so `$HOME; echo x` reaches the child as that text.
- `cwd`: the working directory.
- `env`: `None` lets the child inherit the current environment; a mapping is the child's whole environment, nothing is added.
- `time_limit`: `None` for no limit, otherwise greater than zero (a zero or negative value is a `ValidationError`).
- `merge_stderr`: the child's stderr goes into the same pipe as its stdout, in the order written, and `ProcessResult.stderr` is empty.

The child runs in its own session, with stdin closed. At the `time_limit` the whole process group is killed with SIGKILL, so what the command started ends too, and `run_process` returns with `exit_status=None`, `timed_out=True` and the output written so far. A child that ends in time gives its real exit status and `timed_out=False`; a non-zero status is returned, not raised. Output is decoded as UTF-8 with undecodable bytes replaced. A failure to start, such as `FileNotFoundError`, is an `OSError` and is not caught: the wrapper above decides what it means.

```python
result = run_process(ProcessRequest(argv=["git", "status"], cwd=repo, time_limit=timedelta(seconds=30)))
```

Known limits: after the kill, the output is read without a limit, so a descendant that left the group (by calling `setsid`) and still holds the pipe would block the call; and a child that exits normally but leaves a background process holding its stdout open makes the call wait for that process (bounded by `time_limit` if one is set).

`tests/test_process_search.py` keeps the boundary: only `process.py` imports `subprocess`; `shell=True`, `os.system`, `os.popen`, `os.exec*`, `os.spawn*`, `os.posix_spawn*` and `asyncio.create_subprocess_*` are used nowhere under `src/factory`; and the only suppression markers there are the four in `process.py` (`noqa: S404` and `nosec B404` on `import subprocess`, `noqa: S603` and `nosec B603` on the `subprocess.Popen(` line). Do not write those marker words in a comment or docstring in `src/factory`. Why: see `docs/decisions.md`. Tests run real child processes (Python one-liners through `sys.executable`) in `tmp_path`; nothing is faked.

## Kill points: testing a crash

A test that must show the factory survives its own death arms a kill point. The seam is `factory.domain.kill_points`; the tests that use it to prove recovery come with the recovery features (F0008, F0011).

There are four points, the members of `KillPoint`:

| Point | Value | Reached by |
|---|---|---|
| `AGENT_RUN` | `agent-run` | the two agent runtimes, while an agent runs |
| `BEFORE_PUSH` | `before-push` | the git wrapper, before a push |
| `AFTER_PUSH` | `after-push` | the git wrapper, after a push |
| `AFTER_POST` | `after-post` | the fake hosting service and the PyGithub client, after posting |

This story built only the seam. A wrapper calls `kill_points.reach(point)` at its point in its own story; until then nothing reaches a point.

A new `KillPoints` is inert. In a test, use the `kill_points` fixture from `tests/conftest.py`, which returns a new `KillPoints()` for each test, and hand it to the wrapper under test:

```python
def test_push_dies_after_the_second_try(kill_points: KillPoints) -> None:
    kill_points.arm(KillPoint.BEFORE_PUSH, after=1)
    with pytest.raises(InjectedKill):
        ...  # code that reaches BEFORE_PUSH twice
    assert kill_points.reached(KillPoint.BEFORE_PUSH) == 2
```

- `arm(point)` makes the next `reach(point)` raise `InjectedKill`. `arm(point, after=n)` lets `n` reaches pass first and raises on the next; `after` counts from the arming. A negative `after` raises `ValueError` and changes nothing.
- A point fires once and is then inert again. Arming an armed point replaces the earlier arming. Arming one point never changes another, armed or not.
- `reached(point)` counts every reach, the one that raises included, armed or not.
- Each `KillPoints` instance has its own state.
- `str(InjectedKill(point))` is `injected kill at <point value>`, and `.point` is the point that fired.

`InjectedKill` is a `BaseException`; see `docs/decisions.md`.
